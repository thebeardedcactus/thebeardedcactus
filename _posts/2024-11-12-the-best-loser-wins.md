Last night I created this blog, for reasons that I'm not entirely sure of. Perhaps its the thought of public accountability, as I've never really enjoyed writing in notepads.

My goal over the next several months, infact by March 2025, is to become a consistently profitable trader, but build a secondary income with the potential to eventually replace my primary one.

That $2,500 however was dwinlded down by "death by a thousand cuts""
In my mind if I can lose better, I shall win more. 

After the past few weeks of learning and immersing myself in the market, I do believe there is money to be made. In fact, over the last two days, I managed to scalp a total of $2,500 USD across two trades. Although I ended up giving back most of that profit through several failed entries while trying to refineing my approach.

It doesn’t bother me. I’m learning, and this is all part of the process. I’m going to win, and I’m going to lose.

But what I’ve already realised is that this is a game where the best loser wins.
