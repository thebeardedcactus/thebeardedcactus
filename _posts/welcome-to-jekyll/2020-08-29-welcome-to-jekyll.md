Last night, I started this blog, not fully sure why. Maybe itâ€™s for public accountability, since Iâ€™ve never liked writing in notepads.

My goal by March 2025 is to be a consistently profitable trader and build a secondary income that could replace my primary one.

After the past few weeks of learning, I do believe there is money to be made. In fact, over the last two trading days, I scalped $2,500 in two trades, but gave the majority back as I've been testing different approaches.

It doesnâ€™t bother me. I'm going to win, sometimes I'm going to lose.

But what I think I've realised is that this is a game where the best loser wins.
